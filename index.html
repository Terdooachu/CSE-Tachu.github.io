 <p>
 Have you ever been late to a class, a meeting an event or even a boys or girls night out? then i know you must have been extra late trying to look for a PARKING SPACE. 
 That is where the app PARKING ASSISTANCE comes into play. with the Parking Assistance app even before you get to the parking lot of your destination you can simply see all the available parking spots before you even get there. 
 By logging in or creating an account you can put in your address of your location, have a live feed of what the parking spots look like before then and if they're all full the app will show you the closest parking spots from your destination asides the regular parking spots.
 The app will not only show you the parking spots, the  Parking Assisstant App will also show you how to get to the parking spot and if you miss the route you can always be rerouted. with the Parking Assistance app as long as theres a location, theres a parking lot somewhere nearby.
